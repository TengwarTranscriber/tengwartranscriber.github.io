# About Site

I created this site early 2016 as a way to combine my interests in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, HTML programming, and font creation. I started with the Tengwar Annatar font by Johan Winge, which is free for non-commercial use (and commercial use if you give Johan a free copy of the product.)I used Birdfont, a free font editor by Johan Mattsson, to remap each glyph to the letter(s) it represents in the English Tengwar mode (e.g. 'b' for 'b', 'q' for 'q', 'x' for 'x', etc.) I used the lowercase vowels for the stemless (diacritic only) tehtar, and capital vowels for the stemmed (with vowel carrier) tehtar. I used ligatures to create the tengwar for some common consonant digraphs (e.g. 'sh' for 'sh', 'ng' for 'ng', etc).

This site was originally created with Weebly; I have since completely rebuilt it from scratch and migrated it to Github Pages. This page has been in low maintenance mode since 2020.
